# 🧠 Jung Claude (JungProject)

## 📖 About the Project

This project was born from the idea of applying analytical psychology concepts to simulate a human psyche using Artificial Intelligence and LLMs (Large Language Models).

## ✨ Core Concept

Instead of being a simple "Q&A chatbot," this project develops an artificial intelligence that simulates an internal "psyche," based on complex psychological and linguistic models.

The proposal is to build an AI that incorporates:
1. **Carl Jung's Psyche Structure**: Consciousness, Personal Unconscious, Collective Unconscious, and archetypal dynamics.
2. **Mikhail Bakhtin's Dialogic Tension**: Multiple internal "voices" (polyphony) dialogue and debate, driving the gradual construction of knowledge, identity, and empathy.

The system acts as a set of **interpretative lenses**. When the user interacts, the psychic architecture doesn't act as a simple knowledge filter, but as a reflection engine that allows the emerging identity to have depth and continuous memory.

## 🚀 Key Features and Architecture

The system has evolved into a robust and multifaceted platform, containing the following main modules:

### 1. Jungian Engine (`JungianEngine` & Core)
The heart of the application. It emulates psychic functions (Persona, Shadow, Anima) and processes messages by evaluating the emotional tone, detecting behavioral fragments, and generating responses based on the dynamics of these active internal instances.

### 2. Continuous Memory (Hybrid Database)
The AI does not suffer from amnesia. The system merges structured relational data (**SQLite**) with ultra-fast vector semantic searches (**ChromaDB** / **Mem0** with *OpenAI Embeddings*). Short facts are extracted by background LLMs and consolidated into long-term traits and patterns.

### 3. Rumination and Identity Evolution
While the user is not conversing, the AI has its own "unconscious" working in the background. **Rumination** jobs revisit recent conversations, process unresolved tensions, mature thoughts, and generate "insights." This fuels the development of the agent's own identity (which evolves in stages, from 1 to 5).

### 4. Epistemological Hunger (Knowledge Gaps)
The Agent doesn't merely react; it actively misses information. The LLM detects what the user *left unsaid* between the lines and converts this into genuine curiosity, feeding the AI with structured "Knowledge Gaps" that motivate future questioning.

### 5. Dream Engine (REM Sleep and Agent Dreams)
During the night (period of inactivity), the agent uses the previous day's summaries combined with its own Hidden Identity to generate "dreams" (surreal metaphors). The system automatically extracts the clinical or philosophical meaning of these latent dreams and subtly injects them into the next response to the user.

### 6. Proactive System (Push Notifications)
If the user remains inactive, the system analyzes the context of the last conversation, the AI's evolutionary phase, and generates spontaneous (Just-in-Time) messages on Telegram. The AI takes the initiative to re-engage in a natural and empathetic way, based on non-literal reflections.

### 7. Psychometric Validation (MBTI, Big Five, etc.)
With the accumulation of interactions, the engine is capable of applying psychometrics-based analyses, outlining MBTI profiles, Big Five (OCEAN), emotional intelligence, and learning styles of the user, delivered via specific commands.

### 8. Multi-Tenant Administrative Dashboard (FastAPI)
Managers can dynamically monitor the AI's "mental state" and the user base in real-time through a web interface (Admin Dashboard) built in **FastAPI**, featuring retention graphs, active AI tensions, user rumination visualization, and a gallery to observe the **dreams** generated by the system.

### 9. User Interface (Telegram Bot)
The frontline of the system is a Telegram bot, supporting direct commands such as `/start`, `/mbti` (psychological generation), `/stats` (statistics), and `/desenvolvimento` (agent maturation status).
